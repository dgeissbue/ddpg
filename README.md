## Theory

A first draft on implmenting Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) in python.

Some paper backing the process:
+[Deep Q-Learning to the continuous action domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)
+[Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf)

## Implementation

Implementations follows these excellent ressources:

+[Article from towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-w-keras-openai-dqns-1eed3a5338c) on the concept of Q-learning
+[Keras documentation](https://keras.io/examples/rl/ddpg_pendulum/) on how to adapt reinforcment learning on continuous actions
+[This Github repository](https://github.com/cookbenjamin/DDPG) with very clean (but currenly incomplete) implementation
